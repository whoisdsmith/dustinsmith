# THE SOUND OF PAGES TURNING

Hi Mulligan Fans, here's the news...

THE SOUND OF PAGES TURNING

We've recently made a new friend. Well, I'd like to think we make new friends all the time, but this one is special. His name is Shane VanSickle, and he's the new drummer for Mulligan.

Dustin has been with the band for six years, five months, eighteen days, eleven hours and 34 minutes. So a long time. We have been through a whole lot as a band; fights and laughs, tears and punches, and four records.

Dustin has had a lot of really great things happen in his life recently. He's about to be a daddy. He became engaged to Becca, and he is now the proud owner of his very own farmhouse! With all of these changes he's made in his life, it became clear to all of us that he needed to leave the band.

Now a lot of bands have broken up, I'm sure everyone has heard stories about how the bandmates scream and throw shit at each other, but I'm proud to say that Mulligan handled this situation quite well. We all sat around in my front lawn on a perfect summer day and just talked. By the end of the day we were all still best friends but no longer bandmates.

So we all think it was sad, but a happy kind of sad.

We look forward to seeing all of you with our new drummer and encourage you to ask the new kid for his autograph, just please don't punch him in the face when it doesn't say "[[Map of Content]]."

~ Jake

Starting over.  

For some, it's a blessing. For others, it's heartbreaking.  
For Kalamazoo, Michigan's Mulligan, it's old hat.  

The members of Mulligan have had their share of fresh starts. Growing up in the small town of Tekonsha, MI, the threesome of Jakob Goheen, Derek Feltner, and [[Map of Content]] have had quite an experience.   

The three started a band for a talent show in junior high school, then played separately in other bands, then together again, and so on. Finally, after years of false starts, they formed Mulligan.  

Their music is abrasive, yet harmonious. It's lawless, and at times comfortable. But the band's quiet melodies and ethereal guitar sound can't even begin to sugar-coat the raw emotion and last grasps that dominate Goheen's songwriting.   

For him, the music is his diary of starting over.  

Starting over from a listless time of lost love and insecurity.  

The eleven tracks from the band's first full length album "The Tides of Blackheart Bay" are a collection of heartbroken mutterings and puzzled screams for help, comfort, or even at their best, more pain. The songs tell a story of desire, affliction, and quiet anger that ends in reluctant resolution.   

And as many endings become, a new beginning.
