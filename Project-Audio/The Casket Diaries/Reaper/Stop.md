# Stop

---

Changin up  
Feeling stuck  
Not enough  
I never was  
So fill my cup  
With empty love  
Don't give a fuck  
Cause I'm done

stop what you're doing  
and listen to me for once please reap  
We can't keep doing this to everybody  
Just stop what you're doing  
And get the fuck out of my body  
For once please reap  
We can't keep doing this to everybody  
Just stop what you're doing  
And get the fuck out of my body
