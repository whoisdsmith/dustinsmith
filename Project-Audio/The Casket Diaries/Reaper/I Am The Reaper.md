# I Am The Reaper

---

I don't remember who I was back then  
Before the darkness came and never left  
Cause who I am now is worse than death  
I am the cold air that shivers from your breath  
The reason your eyes glow red  
When you're angry and upset up  
I won't let you forget  
I am your biggest regrets  
I am your silhouette  
When the darkness  
comes to collect  
On all your unpaid debt

I am the reaper  
you just don't know it yet

And somewhere along the way  
I lost myself to all the hate  
And all the pain  
I turned it all into  
Everything I became

I am the reaper  
you just don't know it yet
