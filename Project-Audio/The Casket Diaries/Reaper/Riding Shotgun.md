# RIDING SHOTGUN

---

I just wanted to say that I am sorry  
For all the times I hurt you  
I hope you know I never meant to  
No, no

I got this darkness trapped inside of me  
And I thought that I was in control  
till I realized I was in the passenger seat  
And the reaper was running the show

Oh no I'm not in control  
Of my mind and body anymore  
Oh no here we fucking go though  
As the reaper makes his way into my soul
