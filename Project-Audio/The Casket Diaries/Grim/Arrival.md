REAPER!  
REAPER!  
REAPER!

Ok now listen, gotta get this out my system  
say what I need to say, is it too late?  
Is it too late. is it too late before  
Im lost to the darkness now

Before I descend I break and I bend  
over and over again heart out my chest left me a mess  
I need my friends, where are you now  
no where to die but you left me to drown

REAPER!  
REAPER!  
REAPER!
