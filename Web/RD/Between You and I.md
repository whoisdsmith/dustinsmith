# [A lesson on neglect](https://iamdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/a-lesson-on-neglect/)

This house is empty and so am I.

Regrets haunt me, they eat through these bones and into my soul

I watched you grow up through pictures and phone lines. 

If I could go back I would change everything, I didn't know my job would tear us apart, I didn't know how much I neglected you. A lesson I had to learn too late, by the time I realized what I had done you were gone. 

The hardest lessons we learn too late.  
My chest is empty with out you with me

# [I only feel at home when the darkness consumes me.](https://iamdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/i-only-feel-at-home-when-the-darkness-consumes-me/)

I use to think things couldn't get worse than losing your first pet. I use to think there was nothing worse than being humiliated in front of the whole school back in 4th grade. I use to think there was nothing worse than having a face full of pimples. I use to think there was nothing worse than my first gf breaking up because I wasn't cool enough. I use to think there was nothing worse than having to shower  with everyone else after gym class. I use to think there was nothing worse than my gf breaking up with me to sleep with some douche bag who didn't care about her. I use to think there was nothing worse than hearing the words "im pregnant" while being in the recording studio finishing up final touches for our first record deal. I use to think there was nothing worse than being on tour with two of my best friends, when my fiancé was having complications with my son. I use to think there was nothing worse than working 90 hr weeks and coming home to someone who always complained about me not being around. I use to think there was nothing worse than my fiancé sleeping with someone who was supposed to be a friend. I use to think it couldn't get worse that that. Truth is it can always get worse but hearing the person you have loved so much and for so long tell you that she's pregnant and marrying another man and on top of that taking our son with her as they start a new family, well I don't know if there is anything worse than that but I do know it's been 4 years and Nothings come close to touching those feelings. I am being such a bitch right now, I'll blame lack of sleep and alcohol for this one.

Wednesday morning I had a dream so real, so haunting I woke up and with instant sadness and anxiety. I instantly drank two beers and sat with all of my ghosts. I then did the only thing I knew how to keep them at bay……

I relapsed into a brick of Xanax and 4 flexurals. Some ghosts will always find you, you will never be able to bury all of your past. My mind is weak, my heart seeks peace. I need my son, he's the only one who makes me feel truly alive. God, if you're listening and if you're real. My ears are open, are yours?

She said "this is for the best, I don't care if you think I'm being selfish"  
I replied with "he's all that I have left, what am I suppose to do without him?"  
She said "I don't care what you do, cause we're leaving when the courts say we can move"  
I replied with "what did I do to you to deserve all this hell you've put me through?"

I haven't slept in days and I hate being awake, knowing there's nothing I can do to stop you now. You're on your way traveling 2000 miles away, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think. I don't want to think without you

What do you say since you've been over there, do you tell him that I just don't care?  
What will you say when he wonders about me?  
Will you tell him that life's not fair or that it's my fault that you're over there?  
What do you feel when he talks about me?

She said "this is for the best, I dont care if you think I'm being selfish"  
I replied with "How do you know what's best, when we both know he doesn't understand this?"  
She said "I don't care what you think, cause come December we are moving out of this state"  
I replied with "I'll never understand how you could be so damn cold when were so close"

Days go by and still everything's the same, I've spent everyday blaming myself for things I couldn't change. 

What does he say when he's over there, does he ask you if I even care?  
What do you tell him about me?  
Do you say that I'm doing my best or that I'm just a loser like all the rest?  
What will it take to make this right?

Let's take this back to 02 when it was just me and you and the world was so small. Let's take the bikes down the boardwalk and throw rocks in the river, can we stop for ice cream?

This was you and I on those april nights painting your room in blue, we signed our initials and I got paint all over you. Do you remember?

Let's take this back to the summer of 05, where there's a baby and a bottle and getting up at night. You were there but I was not, I missed the best parts of his entire first year

And I'm sorry, you know that I am sorry. Can we please just get along? I am holding onto my head to keep it intact cause you know that I was wrong. 

We were lovers without friendship and fighting was all we knew, but we were just kids. 

You hurt me and I hurt you, in the end it's all we knew. I'm trying to keep my head in tact cause I was wrong but so were you.

Everyone has something to say about me to you, and I'll take my share of the blame if you do too. 

Let's take this to the present, we hardly speak anymore, is it because I couldn't let go or is it something more?  
Its been four years and I'm learning to forgive, we had Everett together but now it's like I don't exist

I've grown up enough to know you did what you had to do, but its the simple things that still keep me confused. One day I hope we can grow as friends, you don't know what it's like to be on my end.

So let's take this back to that fall night when we first met, let's start over and let's be friends

Dear son, I know it's only been 3 days since you got in that van and drove away. I can't help that I miss you already, Michigan just isn't the same.

Please know that I'm doing my best and I will call as often as I can. I hope you like the new state you're in, I can't wait till I see you again

Hey Georgia, If you're listening please shine bright for my baby and hey B, if your ears are open, please tell E that I love him

Dear son, I know you're growing up so fast, Just stay this little until you come back.  I think about you every minute of the day without you this house isn't the same.

School starts in just a few weeks, please listen to your mom while she's  trying to teach. I hear 1st grade is a lot of fun, enjoy these moments before they are gone.

Hey Georgia, If you're listening please shine bright for my baby. And lately I'm counting the days till you're here for the holidays

I know that this isn't fair but that doesn't mean that I don't care and hey B, if your ears are open, please tell E that I love him

She said "I'm so sorry, please don't hate me" and I knew that she meant it cause she knows what it's like without him. I replied "it's fine and I don't hate you, I forgive you" and I meant it cause I know what it's like to be in love

As I waved goodbye, tears became oceans, and I knew that I was human. There is no greater love than the one for my son and there is no greater loss then watching him drive off, into the future without me. I am left behind  
struggling hard to find who I am with you.  Everything I do has all been cause of you, son you are the best thing to happen to me. I am proud of who you are. I hope you know you make proud. I hope I told you I loved you enough, but what is enough when I could never run out of love for you.

Hey Everett, turn your speakers up and sing along. As I tell the world this is your song.

This day was meant for us  
I never thought that we would give up  
If I could do things over  
I'd find a way to save our love  
I learned that time heals the pain,  
but time can't erase those old feelings  
And when I see your face,  
my heart weakens and I can't breathe  
Straight to my stomach it drops  
once again Im starting to get lost  
In that place where we still exist  
As two lovers who wanted kids

But Then  
Reality sets in, my mind is caving in  
and Im confused again, I break before I bend.  
Will I ever end this fiction in my head?  
I need to try and live a life that you're not in.

(Wake me up from this state im in  
my head is such a mess)  
(Cant I just forget the nights we spent  
we were never meant)  
(Its hard to accept that this is it  
and im still living in)  
(Regrets of what went wrong  
with a past I cant out run)

Wake up, just wake me up

I was living in the hopes that you would stay  
I never knew you were dying just to get away  
I spent those last few months staying up at night  
You spent those months practicing the sound of goodbye

Which meant

No more i Iove yous, no more goodnights  
No more "how was your day" and "are you alright?"  
No more fighting, no more lying, no more reasons to continue trying  
cause whats the point when everything you love is gone  
some will fall apart while others fall back in love

I am in the process of writing a concept record about the past, present and future relationship with my sons mother. I think a lot of people will relate to it because we have all loved and lost. I only have about 10% of this record completed but the cover art is finished, I knew exactly what and how I wanted it to be. The people in it are not me nor anyone I know, just very fitting for the story I am telling..

The first is the front cover and the second is the back cover.

# [An introduction part I](https://iamdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/an-introduction-part-i/)

Posted on [August 8, 2011](https://iamdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/an-introduction-part-i/ "8:14 pm") by [Dustin Smith](https://iamdsmith.wordpress.com/author/wh0isdsm1th/ "View all posts by Dustin Smith")

[Reply](https://iamdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/an-introduction-part-i/#respond)

I am new at this blog stuff, I'm going to try and use this as a new kind of therapy for myself. I read a few blogs that inspired me to try and describe my thoughts. I guess I will start with an introduction..

Part I

I am Dustin Smith. My best friend Kristin started calling me D. Smith about 3 years ago and it has stuck ever since. I am the only child of my mother and my adoptive father, I have 2 sisters and 3 brothers from my seed donor. I don't talk to any of them except my brother James, he's in the army and stationed in iraq, thanks to Facebook we've gotten close the past year or two, other than that I haven't seen him in 20 years. 

I have a 6 yr old son Everett Tyler Lee Smith. He is by far the best thing that ever happened to me, it's easy to talk about him but hard not to get emotional over it. He lives in Fort Benning, GA with his mom, little brother and step dad. I have missed out on more of his life than I have been in it. The first few years were due to neglect cause I thought I could become the next big thing at my job. I worked so much that I don't remember his entire first year. It never even bothered me back then. Looking back now I can't help but to beat myself up over it. A job is just a job no matter what it is or how much you make, it should never be more important than your family or the people you love. I hope one day we can be together more than just the summer and a few holidays.. I hope one day I can forgive myself for the things I've done, but I swear that little boy means everything to me and without him here I always end up lost.

I have been in 3 serious relationships since I was sixteen. One of them was for 3 months, the other was 6 weeks, and my first one was for almost 7 years. That was with my sons mom. She showed me a love I have yet to find from anyone else, not because I haven't tried but because that kind of love takes years to get. She is truly a wonderful woman and two years ago I wouldn't be caught dead giving her a compliment. We have been through hell together but during that hell we learned how to grow and to forgive. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever love someone as much as I did her. It's been 4 years this august since she left me for the man who is now her husband. They had a son together 2 1/2 years ago and Everett loves him to death. It took me almost the entire four years to let go and accept that the past is the past and we can't go back. I think she goes mostly by Rebecca now but she will always be Becca to me. She showed me how to really care about another human being, it was a hard lesson to learn cause I had to watch her fall out of love with me and fall into it with someone else, but in the end I realized all of my flaws and the things I needed to change if I am ever to have a lasting relationship again. I am happy she is happy, I know for a long time she wished she could forget me but I hope now when she looks back she smiles and I hope she never forgets those teenage years we spent together. In the last few months we started being friends, in the past we were either lovers or haters towards each other, we never developed a friendship. I am thankful that we can talk as friends now. Between her and my son I could write pages and pages because they were and are the biggest parts of my life.
