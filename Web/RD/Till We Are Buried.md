Posted on [April 29, 2019April 29, 2019](https://inthecemeteryweather.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/69/) by [Dustin Smith](https://inthecemeteryweather.wordpress.com/author/wh0isdsm1th/)

Instead of messaging you a bunch of shit you won't read, I'll just talk to you here, when you have time to listen. I'm sorry if I stressed you out and pushed you away. I understand the situation and everything you've told me.

We went from talking all the time to hardly at all and my mind is telling me "well if I stressed you out and I pushed you away and we hardly talk and you're down and depressed and feeling some type of way, then who is it that you vent to or talk to, to make you feel better now, if that person isn't me?" I finally understand more clearly why you were always so jealous and insecure in the beginning, because your whole life you've been screwed over and nothing has worked out. Now after all the shit that we've been through I find myself constantly expecting the worse, worrying all the time and being jealous and insecure myself.

Back then I didn't understand it because I had not experienced it like I have now, and instead of being understanding, I got angry and upset and chose to do stupid shit and make mistakes because of my failure to address the reasons why you felt the way you did and for that I am truly sorry.

All I ask is that, since you know what it feels like to have that worry and anxiety like I have now, that you please just try and understand why I feel the way I do and not get upset at me for feeling that way.

In a fucked-up way what I am feeling and going through is actually helped me understand you even more.

With all of that being said, I just want to know if I'm being crazy and paranoid or if you have been talking and hanging out with somebody else, whether it be at work or Cadys. I know you needed a break from everything and went there to escape and have a stress-free environment from everything but the way you ignored me the last 3 times you've been there just sent off every red flag I had, because of what's happened in our past and how it made me feel.

All I wanted was a simple yes or no answer to whether or not you talked or hang out with somebody over there so I can either put my anxiety to rest and feel stupid or so that I can leave you alone to do as you please, because it's not fair to me if you're talkin and hanging out with somebody else when it could have been me instead. If you are talking to somebody else or want to talk to somebody else that's fine and I understand.

I know we can't have what we want with each other right now because of the situation. I just need somebody to talk to, I feel so alone but I don't want to bother you cuz I don't want to stress you out. I need to put the anxiety to rest one way or another. All I want simple yes or no to the one thing that's holding me back right now from staying focused.

Please try and be patient and understanding with me and not angry and mad. You know what these feelings feel like and had I known how this feels 7 years ago, we wouldn't be where we are. I paid a huge consequence for not being understanding, please don't make the same mistakes as I did.

## [Bare your soul with me.](https://inthecemeteryweather.wordpress.com/2019/03/14/bare-your-soul-with-me/)

Posted on [March 14, 2019](https://inthecemeteryweather.wordpress.com/2019/03/14/bare-your-soul-with-me/) by [Dustin Smith](https://inthecemeteryweather.wordpress.com/author/wh0isdsm1th/)

I want to try things differently. I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything and everything with me. I want your honesty in ways you could never give it before.

I made a form, I want you to fill out when you get a chance. Questions that will be most difficult and uncomfortable to answer. They aren't meant to make you uncomfortable or awkward, they're meant for you to open up and be so honest about things so that we can build a relationship where you can always talk to me about anything and everything.

I'm such a mess of mass confusion right now. I feel like everything I tell you, I end up completely contradicting myself, cause I say a lot of positive shit when I'm in a good place and than I just go and fuck it all up when the floor gives out underneath me.

I'm confused and sad not because you have to sleep with him but because you told me you weren't going to and didn't tell me that you did and it's really not as big of a deal as I'm making it out to be, I'm just caught in my feelings because you told me that shit and then you turn right around and tell me you love me all the time and I just can't make sense of how you weren't able to be straight up with me at first but could easily just tell me you love me cause you know it calms me and brings me peace.

This is the shit I'm talking about when I say it's hard for me to tell you how I feel cause I know it's just going to make you feel worse but that's not what I'm trying to do here at all. I don't want to lie to you and tell you I'm fine if I'm not fine, I want to be able to say how I'm feeling and for you to try and understand it. Please don't be mad at me. I gotta go to work. I do love you, I do want to be with you, maybe we just jumped the gun too soon, with the kisses and hugs and I live you's. I don't know…
