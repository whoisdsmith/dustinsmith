We've dried our eyes and sadly accepted that, after 24 years, 2018 will be the  
**[Vans Warped Tour](https://www.altpress.com/tags/tagged/tag/warped+tour)**  
's [last  
year](https://www.altpress.com/features/entry/kevin_lyman_final_warped_tour_interview).  
To aid in everyone's [healing  
process](https://www.altpress.com/features/entry/warped_tour_musicians_react),  
we're taking a nostalgic look back at the legendary punk-rock festival a  
decade ago, just shy of the [long-awaited final lineup  
announcement](https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/warped_tour_lineup_announcement_details_2018)  
March 1.

However—from **[Katy Perry](https://www.altpress.com/tags/tagged/tag/katy-

—Warped Tour 2008's unimaginable lineup may give you another reason to cry.  
Strap on your seatbelt, and set the dial 10 years back: Here's your time  
machine ride through a wild year from Warped Tour's past.

**"OUR ANNUAL GUIDE TO THE ONLY SUMMER TOUR THAT MATTERS"**

In 2008, AltPress rightfully deemed Warped Tour 2008 "the only summer tour  
that matters," scouring the lineup for its most exciting acts and crafting an  
epic set of August covers. Seriously, they should be framed.

A blue-hued AP 241.1 featured a tied up (literally) Max Bemis from **Say  
Anything** , Travie McCoy from **Gym Class Heroes** (all-hail the Decaydance  
era), Stephen Christian from **Anberlin** and Cory Brandon from **Norma  
Jean**. Creating a nice color complement, a yellow-hued AP 241.2 featured an  
up-close **Tom DeLonge** of **Angels& Airwaves**, Fred Mascherino of **the  
Color Fred** , Patricia Day of **HorrorPops** , and Matt Thiessen of **Reliant  
K**. The color palette was completed with a hot pink centerfold.

**KICK OFF**

Warped 2008 kicked off Friday, June 20, 2008 in Pomona, California at the  
Pomona Fairgrounds. The 46-date tour rounded out Sunday, Aug. 17, 2008 in  
Carson, California at the Home Depot Center after traversing the United States  
and parts of Canada (four cities and dates, to be exact).

The madness continues. Warped Tour 2008 also displayed sprawling Ernie Ball  
Battle of the Bands and Kevin Says… stages, giving the newest of the new a  
shot at a performance on the game-changing festival. Browsing through these  
crazy lineups, we find some familiar names: **[Chelsea

**WARPED DEBUTS**

Now certified Warped Tour Veterans, We The Kings (who released their self-  
titled debut the year prior), Four Year Strong, Pierce The Veil (who released  
albums the year before) and Bring Me The Horizon (who released their sophomore  
album Suicide Season that year) all had their first cross-country run on  
Warped in 2008.

Angels & Airwaves, Cobra Starship, August Burns Red, Automatic Loveletter,  
Jack's Mannequin, Jeffree Star and Say Anything made their Warped debuts in  
2008 as well.

**KATY PERRY SPENDS A SUMMER ON WARPED TOUR**

As you can see above, Patricia Day, representing her "rockabilly chanteuse"  
HorrorPops, graced the cover of AP 241.2. However, as revealed in our  
anniversary ["20 things you didn't know about  
AP"](https://www.altpress.com/features/entry/alternative_press_things_you_didnt_know/P1)  
article, many were lobbying for a new, up-and-coming singer to be on the cover  
in that spot. The singer was Katy Perry (maybe you've heard of her), who, with  
her debut album and one hit at the time, landed a summer-long gig on Warped  
Tour. However, one editor-type put his foot down, arguing Perry and her  
colorful, new-age pop was not punk.

Back in 2015, Perry talked to *[USA

anniversary-katy-perry-fall-out-boy-echosmith/71269796/)* about her stint on  
Warped Tour.

"A lot of times, you'd just find me hanging over the crowd," she said. "Stage-  
diving and throwing myself into the pit.

"I was very involved in that kind of lifestyle."

Although times have changed, it seems Perry hasn't let go of her Warped Tour  
roots.

"I still have a bit of that California punk-rock attitude always with me," she  
said. "I'm happy that my first tour was Warped Tour. I really got my bearings  
there."

So much so, when the tour announced that 2018 was its end, the massive  
superstar posted an Instagram goodbye.
