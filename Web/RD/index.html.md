The Latest News...**  

Hey everyone! It's rollin on! Another rockin summer and I finally updated the  
site! Stop the press! New Show added at the civic cetnter on Wed, June 26th  
check the shows page for more info! Thanks for being here! | ** Welcome to  
the B.E. Henry Building! **  
The B.E. Henry building is a hall where I book shows in Marshall, Mi. The B.E.  
has a long history of shows of all types, particularly punk. Hundreds of bands  
have played the B.E. over the years, including as well known acts as Good  
Riddance, 88 Fingers Louie, Swingin Utters, Quincy Punks, The Bollwevills,  
Small Brown BIke, At the Drive-In, and Alkaline Trio. If there's a local band  
you've ever seen , they've probably been there. Shows are always all ages and  
usually feature a vairied lineup of local and touring bands of all types from  
all over the country.br>

**_**So what's the deal with this place?**_**  
The deal is this: I book anyone with a good attitude and a desire to play.  
There's no big P.C. trips or "only this music" or "only that music" attitudes.  
We're all here for one reason : to share music with each other and have a good  
time. I don't care if your band sucks or you are God's gift to music, if you  
play punk , emo, metal, rap, country, new wave, noise, hardcore, thrash, or  
Martian bagpipe music, we are all equals at the B.E. .

***So how about gas money...***  
I spend about renting the building and setting up the show, and that is all I  
try to get from the door.(note : I say ***try*** )The rest is split between  
bands based on drive time. So here's an example : If your from Grand rapids  
and your playing with a band from Marquette and a band from Muskegon and a  
band from Flint, your band gets the least followed by Flint then Muskegon then  
the band from Marquette gets almost everything cause they drove like triple  
what everyone else did. Got it?

![](/images/dontlookdown.jpg) Chicago's _Much the same _ | ** How Do you  
determine playing order? **  
What I do is simply play it by ear. Like with a touring band or a band from  
way out of town I just wait until the evening looks prime and then have them  
play then. The short drive guys usually open and the local guys with the big  
crowd play last so the kids stick around. BR>

So have a look around, And see a little into what we've got going here in  
Marshall, and mayby you'll come out and see what's up for yourself. Drop me a  
line or just show up, you're always welcome. See you soon!
