A second chance. In musk, it means three guys from Tekonsha starting over. Jakob Goheen, Derek Feltner, and Dustin Smith form the indie-rock band Mulligan, which will release its first full-length album during a CD release party Saturday at Club Soda, 340 E.

Michigan Kalamazoo. The CD, "The Tides of Blackheart Bay," took nearly six months to complete and features 12 tracks. The release, on Kalamazoo's Hearts On Fire Records label, follows three EPs that the band previously released on its own. The trio grew up in Tekonsha where they performed at high school talent shows, after football games at Colleen's house and wherever they could. rir At the age of 6, Goheen got his first guitar from an uncle.

He A took lessons for 13 years in classical, jazz, rock, music theory, musk literature and anything that would help him become a better musician. "I've been playing guitar way -longer than I've not been playing," said Goheen, 20. "My parents are the utmost supportive. They've been buying me guitars and -equipment since I was young. I think they're looking for a return investment" If anything, the trio's parents can be proud of the new CD their will release the weekend.

When it came time to perform at "The Cabaret," Smith was asked to help Goheen and Feltner by stepping in as drummer.

His only experience was playing around on the drum set in the school's band room.

From that day the group worked to perfect its sound, its style and cohesheness. They write all their own songs and Feltner and Goheen sing the lyrics they wrote to make it even more personal. The band members have parted ways a couple times, fought over the same girls and disagreed on agreeing. Smith recalls fighting with Goheen over who got to ride "shotgun" with Feltner, the first to get his license. Bonding, it seems, in a much more fraternal order than just friends.

"It's crazy how far we've come," Smith said. "You look back at the past and laugh at how dumb you were.
