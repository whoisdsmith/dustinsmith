# [For You](https://illseeyouinanotherlife.wordpress.com/)

Life is all about moments of impact and how they change our lives forever

# [Stevie Marie](https://illseeyouinanotherlife.wordpress.com/2018/01/28/stevie-marie/)

I can't sleep, no I can't sleep

cause you're stuck in my head on repeat

wish you were here with me

wish the last 9 months was all a dream

it took me so long to finally move on

didn't have a choice you were already gone

the beat in my heart knows you're my favorite song

how do I sleep next to someone else when it now feels wrong

your my gravity's pull

my favorite soul

the warmth of the sun

when it starts to get cold

All I want is your love

all I want is your trust

all I want is to be enough

will I ever be enough

youre In my head again

its hard to play pretend

its hard to be your friend

When I just want to hold you instead

# [The last letter I'll ever write to you](https://illseeyouinanotherlife.wordpress.com/2018/01/28/the-last-letter-ill-ever-write-to-you/)

Hey Stevie, are you out there?  
Can you hear me? Am I loud and clear?

How have you been? Is everything ok? Did you find love again? Is your life better this way?

Do you smile more? Do you cry less?  
Is your mind at war? Are you feeling stressed?

What's new with you? Are you different now? Have you found yourself??

Can you sleep at night? Do you ever think of me? Does he treat you right? Are you really happy?

Did you find yourself? Do you smile more? Do you have regrets? Did you find what you were looking for?  
Do you ever look back? Do you ever second guess? ? Am I still second best?

Do you remember that night at B&N back in November when we first met? You pulled me close so you could kiss me I was so nervous I couldn't breath.

Looking back now what would you have changed? Would you still love me or would I be erased? I hope you know I'll always miss your face, I hope you'd find live in yourself some day

Honestly for me, I wouldn't change a thing, I'd travel back in time to relive every memory. Maybe then you'd see, how much you meant to me and maybe then you'd never have given up on me. But that's just a fantasy that I'd much rather believe cause sometimes the painful thought of reality is just too unbearable for me. I hope youre happy, I hope you found yourself this time, I'm sorry that I was boring

You always wanted me to chase you well look what I'm doing  
You always wanted a song so just listen to what I'm singing

You said I only cared after it was too late  
But baby I cared about you every single day  
I hope you don't ever forget about me  
cuz I don't want to be a forgotten memory  
I wish things could have been different maybe they still could be but we'll never know cuz that's something you refuse to believe. This is your song, one I hope that you'll sing. I wish we could have had a better ending. You'll always be my favorite melody, you'll always live inside these harmonies. I love you forever and always, till death do us part whether you're buried beside me

I've been trying to let go of you, inside I'm dying cause I don't want to

I know we don't speak unless you need something from me. I miss you every day that's fucking sad to say. Guess this marriage meant something but you it meant nothing

Baby I'm sorry it took so long, I know you're gone but please don't move on, please hang on, I feel so lost this all feels wrong.

Tell me I'm still sleeping, tell me that I'm just dreaming and when the morning comes you'll be wrapped up in the blankets with me

Tell me you still love me, tell me I'm not crazy  
Tell me it's not the end, tell me we're still a family,  
tell me everything is still the same, tell me we didn't get divorced and you still have my last name.  
Please wake me up from this hell  
you promised me forever, this can't be real  
Baby is this real? Are you really gone?  
Are we out of touch? Did our signals get lost?  
Oh God reality is setting in, this is it, this is the end. The end of everything that had anything to do with you and me. Baby I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. You're too far out of reach, I can't see you, I can't feel you, I can't hold you. Where are you, who are you now? Are you out there? Can you hear me? How did we lose touch? How did you get to where you're at? Oh God this is the end, I feel my heart sinking in, I know I have to let you go but I don't know how, you're all I know, where do I go? What will I do without you? Who am I when I'm without you? Baby I'm sorry, I'm losing my grip, I know this is the end. Goodbye my love, this time I accept the truth, I'll sign those papers on the dotted line and begin a new life without you.

There's no more time, I'll see you in anotherlife

Baby I'm sorry, baby please don't leave  
Come and rescue me, like that song we use to sing,

Baby I'm struggling, baby I'm drowning I must be dreaming you said you'd never leave me

This can't be real, please wake me up  
Please tell me we're still in love  
I'm in our room but where are you?  
This is our house but it's empty now

Get me out of this place, I can't be awake grab my hand and show me the way  
I can't see your face this is a mistake  
What about fate? you're my soulmate

Don't let me go, please don't let me go  
Where are you? why can't you hear me?  
If this is a dream than why am I not sleeping?  
Why am I back at our first house? Why is there no trace of you here? This is a dream  
I'm just walking in my sleep. None of this is real, I'm back in Marshall at 816, I'm upstairs asleep, trapped inside a dream I have to be please baby wake me up, I've never been so lost. Give me a sign that you're alright, tell me we're fine, tell me you're here by my side, tell me I'm in a coma from the other night there was an accident and I'm trapped inside

Nothing makes sense, memories of another life keep flashing by but that can't be right because I see you with some other guy and I see myself alone at night, it looks like we don't even talk anymore, why do we not speak to each other?
