MORE MERCH AND EXPANDED WEB SITE  
We have added buttons to our merch section. We currently have 8 different designs available for  
purchase. We will also have 2 separate designs available for free at any of our shows. Collect all 10!  
Can an emo band have a fun section? The answer is yes. We have made more additions to our website. We  
now have wallpaper and buddy icons available for download.  
We have also added more pictures to the photo gallery from our most recent show at Alvins in Detroit.  
Don't forget, if you register in the gallery you can send e-cards and leave comments on the photos.
