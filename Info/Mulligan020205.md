BAD WEATHER SHOW TONIGHT AT CLUB SODA IN KALAMAZOO  
We are having another Club Soda show for all of you that couldn't make it to the CD release because of  
the blizzard. West Michigan Music.com is having a "Six More Weeks of Rockin" Groundhog Day show. The  
Last Campaign, A Sumner Formal, and Hopeless Heroes will be performing as well. We'll also have our
