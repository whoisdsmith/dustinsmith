Hello, friends of Mulligan. Here is the news for this week.  
UPCOMING SHOWS!  
We have a few shows coming up this weekend in the Kalamazoo area so come out and say hello.  
This Friday Mulligan will be playing at Bigelow Hall on the campus of WMU with Your Best Friend, Nice  
Try, and The Last Campaign. The show starts at 7 p.m. and all ages are welcome.  
For all you drinkers the party will be Saturday at the Corner Bar with our friends from Detroit,  
Within Four Walls. Also making a comeback will be our good buddies Oceans of Regret. This is a do not  
miss show. Doors open at 9:00 p.m.

MUSIC REVUE IS THE BOMB  
If you haven't already picked up the October issue of Music Revue, get off your ass and get it. Thumb  
on over to page 10 and check out what Yvonne Glasgow had to say about us on her editor's page. Here  
are a few quotes. "I heard the end of their set one night at Club North and was amazed. This 3 piece  
has a killer indie rock sound that is more put together than some of the nationally or semi-nationally  
signed indie acts." Thanks Yvonne! Check out the November issue of Music Revue for an exclusive  
interview with Mulligan.

T-SHIRTS & BUTTONS  
we have very few medium t-shirts left. We also only have 4 of the 4-pack buttons left. Get them while  
you can. You can always get stuff at any of our shows but if you can't get out, you can get them  
online. Check out:

DEREK IS ON THE RADIO  
If you live in the Kalamazoo area, tune in to 89.1 WIDR-FM every Thursday from 10 p.m. - Midnight for  
the local music show. Derek, aka. DJ D-rock, is a permanent fixture on the show and will regale all  
with tales of life at Bob & Kay's carwash. They have a shark tank ya know.
