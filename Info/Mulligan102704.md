Happy Halloween, Mulligan Fans!  
TONIGHT AT THE CLUB SODA  
Tonight MULLIGAN will be playing at Club Soda in Kalamazoo with SMALL SPACE from Grand Rapids, A  
PERFECT KISS from Maryland, and LADY OF THE LAKE from Texas for the HEARTS ON FIRE RECORDS showcase.  
The show starts at 9:30PM and is $5 at the door if you're 17 and up. See you there!

WEST MICHIGAN COMPILATION CD  
The boys will have a song on a currently untitled compilation CD featuring West Michigan bands.  
The song will most likely be an exclusive that isn't on any other disc. Look for it in January.

T-SHIRTS, STICKERS & BUTTONS  
We have very few medium t-shirts left. We also only have 4 of the 4-pack buttons left. Get them while  
you can. You can always get stuff at any of our shows but if you can't get out, you can get them  
online. Check out:

PUREVOLUME AND GARAGEBAND  
If you haven't checked out Mulligan's music on PureVolume or GarageBand.com, make sure to stop by and  
listen to a few tracks.  
This will help the band get more exposure and new fans!
