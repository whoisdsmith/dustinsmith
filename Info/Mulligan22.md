# Mulligan22

After playing together for over five years, "Mulligan" (Jakob G. -guitar/vocals) (Derek Feltner-  
bass/vocals) (Dustin Smith-drums) have become known as the tightest and most experienced  
musicians in their scene.  
Playing more shows than any of them can count; they have developed a strong stage presence  
combined with the knowledge of what moves the crowd. Selling over 1,000 copies of their first  
album recorded for only $500.00 (2000) and over 2,000 of their "Hearts on Fire E.P." (2002)  
to date shows just how much their fans respect the efforts put into each and every show these  
young men play. With a sound harder to place than most bands, "Mulligan" walks a thin line  
between a hardcore and indie sound.  
The influences of years of jazz training and favorite current bands produce a "textured" sound  
with more depth than most bands in the same genre. The latest songs written are considered the  
bands best work. Available early summer 2004, "The Grey Vs. Black E.P." is sure to strike a  
resound chord in the music scene. With tracks like Kill devil hills, This distance in miles, and the  
title track Grey Vs. Black; Mulligan seems destined to become a force to be reckoned with.
